# Ángel Castañeda's Résumé

Last year, I did a favor for my friend's dad and made him a new cv in 
$\LaTeX{}$. I ended up converting my own cv and have maintained it on and off
ever since.

I was inspired by [EJ Mastnak](https://www.ejmastnak.com) to finally do the sensible thing 
and version control my code instead of making more and more copies of it on 
Overleaf.

## getting a pdf

you can self compile by cloning this repo and just running `make` to get my cv
or `make cover` to get my (unsigned) cover letter template. 

Or just visit [www.acsq.me/cv](https://www.acsq.me) to make it easy.
